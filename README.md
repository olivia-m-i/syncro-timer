# Syncro-Timer documentation

Sample product and API documentation for the new Syncro Timer feature. 

* [Product documentation here](./docs/product/README.md)

* [API documentation here](./docs/api/README.md)

## Considerations

* This format roughly mimics my current documentation workflow (working in a repo with markdown files).
Normally, I'd deploy with a static site generator, but for my purposes here, I'm simply calling all files README.md 
in their respective folders so that GitHub will render a preview.

* I'll be using the style I currently use for my work, which is essentially Microsoft's with some modifications. 

* API docs are inspired by customer.io's format, but necessarily different due to the lack of template here.

* I made many small assumptions which I won't list here but would be happy to point out.
